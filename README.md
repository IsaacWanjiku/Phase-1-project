# Project Title: Data-Driven Selection of Aircraft
This title reflects the goal of analyzing data to assess risks and guide the decision-making process for selecting aircraft in the new aviation venture.
# Project Overview
For this project, I will perfom various actions including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for the business stakeholder. This will involve use of Python language and CRISP-DM methodology.
# Business Understanding
The company seeks to identify the lowest-risk aircraft for purchase by considering factors such as safety records, operating costs, and customer demands, using aviation data from the National Transportation Safety Board.
# Data Understanding & Analysis
Initial steps focus on gaining insights from the data, followed by analysis to support decision-making.
Analyzed aircraft models with the fewest recorded incidents.

## Data Visualization;- with a number graphs to show

# Conclusion
Identified aircraft models with low accident rates and strong safety records.
Prioritized models that operate well in challenging weather conditions.
Thus recommend this aircraft based on incident rate and other factors: this aircraft types;- KnaKenDacWel, Menees, Menzimer, Mercer, Merchant since they have the least incident cases and seem to be reliable in this case.
## Next Steps: 
Further assessment and pilot small-scale operations with identified aircraft models to validate real-world performance.
